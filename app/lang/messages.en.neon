    focusBazaar:
        heading: "Focus Bazaar"
        content: "This bazaar is an alternative to regional flea markets and garden bazaars. Nowadays, in the era of the internet, it's easy to take a photo of an item and post it with a description on these pages! You can actually use a virtual flea market that isn't limited in time, as is the case with the physical one. This regional bazaar has its specifics compared to other bazaar servers. It assumes that the potential buyer will stop by personally to inspect the item and then pay you. This eliminates the big hassle of how to pack the item, the cost of postage and cash on delivery, going to the post office and standing in line, and last but not least, the elimination of problems with complaints about the item or non-receipt of the item by the customer. You can therefore offer even items of negligible value."
